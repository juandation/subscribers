Create an API using node.js and express.js for the backend, and mysql for the database. Then we will use react for the Frontend.

1. Create the Server.

3. Connect the Database with the server.
4. Create the routes and the controllers for the API
5. Make the query.
6. Create our Client App.
7. Structure the project.
8. Make the request to our endpoint.
9. Handle the response and display the table.
10. Methods for sort by name, age and sport.
